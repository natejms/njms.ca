Until more recently, the idea of digital sovereignty felt fairly foreign to me. Sure, I use lots of open source software, but I remained very technologically dependent in a way. Google's software suite is a good example of this: no matter how hard I tried to avoid Google services, I'm still tethered to the platform in one way or another. Though I've managed to push Google Search out of my life, I keep finding myself using their music streaming platform to listen to podcasts and their operating system on my daily commute.

However, I've taken it upon myself to push further towards total digital sovereignty. <span data-separator></span>

## Everything on the blockchain

Sure, there's a handful of dApps on the market that could *theoretically* replace some of the ubiquitous and centralized platforms most normal people would use, though many are still under development, scams, suffering from severe fatal flaws or competing with other open source projects for some reason.

The Golem network is a great example of the first issue. Now, I've been waiting for something like this for a while. Ever since mining Monero on my PC became worthless, I've been searching for a new way to rent out my idle processing power. Golem, however, is still in its early stages running only on the Ethereum Testnet, which is kind of sad. Scams, on the other hand, are much more interesting. As of me writing this, there are 1506 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap the vast majority of those are likely either dead projects or pump and dump schemes. Many less qualified people are entering the industry without the technical expertise to launch a network driven by blockchain technology and deliver a legitimate product.

Then you have platforms like Steemit where rich people essentially control the media and the numerous cryptocurrencies that purportedly aim to achieve the same goal as literally every other currency on the market. Claims about how they plan on "digitally empowering the masses, liberating the economy and returning power to the people" sound more like the remarks of a dictator brainwashing the population than sections of an open source project's mission statement.

So those are a few issues with various blockchain projects, but thankfully, not everything is "on the blockchain," as they would say. I really don't need Ethereum to serve MP3 files to my phone when I'm away from my hard drive. That's why self hosted platforms are so great. Sadly, there are a few issues with those as well.

## The lack of infrastructure

Currently, my entire infrastructure is composed of two laptops in my basement. One of which is more than five years old, while the other is probably almost ten years old. Somehow, these two devices have managed to hold up fairly well against everything I've thrown at them. Even better, I have at least three more functioning laptops just enough Ethernet ports on my router to help distribute the load if it ever comes to that. So in reality, my infrastructure is *good enough*. It's not great, but it's unlikely I'll ever be handling more than four concurrent connections at a given time. Unless, of course, my Rocket.Chat server really takes of (hint: it probably won't).

Servers can be a serious issue for others, however, especially when ISPs start blocking ports. I was lucky enough to not have any issues in that regard. Thankfully, it isn't too difficult to configure your server (or servers) to run on other, non-blocked ports. If you don't have the hardware or a good enough internet plan to handle as many connections as you'll be receiving, that's another issue. In most cases, you'll need a dedicated box to run your server, which is not something that everyone has access to.

The moment you need to pay someone else to do it for you, you've taken a step further away from that total state of digital sovereignty.

Nevertheless, I have taken it upon myself as a sort of new year's resolution to become less reliant on others to provide me with services online. So far, I've managed to launch both a Nextcloud and Rocket.Chat server (as mentioned earlier), and I'm working on moving off several other platforms in the near future.

I also plan on writing more about this ambitious plan. I'll probably write a few articles on the benefits and drawbacks of different self hosted platforms and-of course-how to self-host them!

Hopefully I don't get hit by a DDoS attack since using Cloudflare would open another point of failure and require me to give up my digital sovereignty.
