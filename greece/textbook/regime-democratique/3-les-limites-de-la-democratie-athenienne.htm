		Les limites de la démocratie athénienne
	</h1>
	<p>
		Compared to that of our society, the Athenian democracy presented several
		limits. These limits can be categorized into two groups: how a citizen is
		defined and direct participation.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Canada, everyone born here gets to vote at the age of eighteen. Further,
		immigrants also get to vote after living here for three years. In Athens,
		only free, of-age men of Athenian descent could vote. This group makes up
		around fifteen percent of the population, meaning 15% of the Athenian
		population governed the other 85%, without them getting a say in the
		matter.
	</p>
	<p>
		Further, to participate in the ecclesia, you needed to be at the location
		in the city of Athens. This meant that while many citizens outside the city
		were permitted to vote, doing so was out of the question. For this reason,
		only around 10 000 of the 40 000 citizens were considered active, while the
		rest were inactive.
	</p>

		Despite these limits, Athens was still a very powerful state in its time.
