This has really got me thinking about how (or rather, why) the dark web is painted with such a horrid image. Sure, there are black markets operating over Tor Onion Services, but surely there&apos;s also plenty of black markets operating on the clearnet, down my street and all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&apos;s the big deal?&lt;/p&gt;

Let&apos;s take a look at a definition &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;taken from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In programming languages, closures (also lexical closures or function closures) are techniques for implementing lexically scoped name binding in languages with first-class functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s, well, not very intuitive. To be fair, closures aren’t an incredibly intuitive thing when you define them like that. I’m certain, however, that though breaking this definition down things will become much clearer. Let’s take a look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;someFunction(param, function() {
  // do something
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this gets a little bit cumbersome after a while. Not only are function expressions long, they include a kitchen sink of features that you probably won&apos;t need in all cases, like the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; constructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, in EMCAScript 6, we got this whole new and improved arrow function. Let&apos;s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
